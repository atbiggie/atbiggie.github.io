## My (not so hot) take on R

I wasn’t looking forward to learning R…

When I started my first R class almost two years ago, I wasn’t all that
excited about it. I was more comfortable in SAS and had dabbled a bit in
Python, and I was content with limiting my coding knowledge to those two
languages. R just looked… ugly?

After I got over my initial disgust toward the syntax, I realized that
the same nasty looking syntax was surprisingly very easy to learn. The
more capable I became as an R programmer, the more I realized that I
could perform many of the same analyses and render the same plots that I
could in SAS, only in much fewer lines of code and often with better
graphics.

I especially appreciate the capability to create nicely formatted html
pages as well as interactive graphics. Although I miss the visual appeal
of a detailed and hierarchically formatted SAS proc step, I can finally
say that I prefer R as my primary coding language because of its ease of
use, flexibility, and intuitive (albeit ugly) syntax.
