Hi! My name is Autumn Biggie and I am an Intern for [Red Rooster Data Analytics](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlinton-flores/) as well as an M.S. Candidate in Statistics at North Carolina State University. I have a particular interest in statistical consulting and experimental design, especially in the areas of human rights research and traditional medicine. During my undergraduate career, I worked as a Critical Thinking Unit Fellow for the [AHA Foundation](theahafoundation.org), functioning as an event planner to create spaces for survivors and advocates to share their experience and expertise about Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), honor violence, and child marriage. During my career as a statistician, I hope to be involved in preventing these issues by conducting up-to-date research on their prevalence and presenting the information to decision makers. 

### More Information

**Where are you from?**  
Originally, I'm from a small town called Zebulon, which is about 30 minutes east of Raleigh, North Carolina. I currently live in the city of Raleigh, although I wish to eventually live abroad.

**Do you have family close by?**  
Yes! My parents reside in Zebulon, NC. My two older brothers live in the area around Raleigh as well and my sister is living in New York. I also just got engaged and my fiancee and I are looking at staying in the Raleigh area.  

**What are your hobbies?**  
Some of my hobbies are doing home workouts, hiking, camping, leatherwork, macrame, handbuilding pottery, and traveling. I've been to Germany, Austria, Switzerland, St. Lucia, the Dominican Republic, and I just spent a month earning my TEFL Certification in Costa Rica this past summer. I hope to visit many more places soon! I don't have any pets but one of my life goals is to own a Chinese Water Dragon. I have a couple of beloved house plants named Mitch and Eddie (snake plant and pathos).
